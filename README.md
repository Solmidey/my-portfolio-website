# Immersive Portfolio Website

A single-page, highly visual portfolio experience designed to showcase professional achievements, GitHub projects, and dimensional design explorations.

## Features

- **3D hero cube** with animated faces highlighting skill keywords.
- **Ambient gradient lighting** and floating orbs to set a cinematic mood.
- **Project grid** with interactive tilt motion for each GitHub repository highlight.
- **Dimensional gallery** featuring 3D-inspired concept cards.
- **Responsive layout** with adaptive navigation and accessible semantics.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience.

## Customisation tips

- Replace "Your Name" with your own branding in `index.html`.
- Update the project cards with links to your actual GitHub repositories.
- Swap the copy across sections to reflect your voice, experience, and goals.

Feel free to extend the gallery with real prototypes or integrate frameworks like Three.js for even richer 3D interactions.
